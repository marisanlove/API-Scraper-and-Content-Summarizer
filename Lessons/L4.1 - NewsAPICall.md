## 1. Create an HTTP connection to the NewsAPI API

Let's create a new function in ```APITest.py``` called ```newsAPIRequest```. After we've tested it and made sure it works, we'll copy it over into ```utils.py``` so that  ```newsPopulateDB``` can call it.

```python
def newsAPIRequest(query:str = query) -> dict:
```

Inside it, we're going to create an HTTP connection similar to how we did with Twitter. To recap, an HTTP connection is a communication channel between a client and a server that allows the client to send HTTP requests to the server and receive HTTP responses in return.

We will create an HTTP connection using the 
```python
http.client.HTTPSConnection 
```
class from the Python ```http.client``` library.

Once an HTTP connection has been established, the client can send HTTP requests to the server using various methods such as ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, ```DELETE```, etc.

Let's first establish a connection to newsapi.org
```python
conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("newsapi.org")
```

Next, we need to make a request using the GET keyword. But first, we need to specify some other things: ```payload``` and ```headers```.

- Payload: the data that is sent to the server as part of the request message. The payload can include form data, files, or other data that needs to be transmitted to the server.
- Headers: a collection of key-value pairs that are included in the HTTP request message and provide additional information about the request. They can be used to specify various options or preferences for the request, such as the preferred content type, encoding, language, or other HTTP-related details.

For our request, we will have no payload because we just want to make a request, and our headers will be our API key.

To get our API key, we will need to register an account by clicking the button in the top right and registering an account.

Store this as another secret, similar to how you stored your Twitter keys. Call it ```newsapi_apikey```. 

Add this to your newsAPIRequest() function:
```python
payload = ''
headers = {
    'Authorization': os.environ['newsapi_apikey'],
    'User-Agent': os.environ['newsapi_apikey']
  }
```
## 2. Make a request and turn it into a dictionary

```conn.request``` is a method of the ```http.client.HTTPSConnection``` class that sends an HTTP request to the server. It takes four arguments:

- method: the HTTP method to use for the request, such as GET, POST, PUT.
- url: the URL to send the request to. This can include the path to the resource on the server and any query string parameters.
- body: the data to include in the request payload. This can be a string, a bytes object, or a file-like object.
- headers: a dictionary containing the headers to include in the request.

For our request, our method will be ```'GET'```, our body will be our ```payload``` variable, and our headers will be our ```headers``` variable.

For our url, we need to find the endpoint of the NewsAPI. See here for a list: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints. We will use ```/v2/everything``` .

Our endpoint has additional parameters that we can include. See a list here: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything. For our url, we will provide a ```q```, ```searchIn```, ```from```, ```sortby```, and ```language```. 

- ```q``` specifies our query; what news articles we want to search for. This will be passed in by the user.
- ```searchIn``` just tells the API where to look for our query. We can look in either the title, description, or content of articles.
- ```from``` lets us filter by date. We pass in a date (and time) for the _oldest_ article allowed.
- ```sortby``` just tells us how to sort the results. We can sort by relevancy, popularity, or pubishedAt.
- ```language``` will just be set to ```'en'```

for our ```q``` parameter, we need to replace all the spaces with "%20". If you look at any URL, there are never any spaces, but rather, they are replaced with "%20". We do this by calling ```.replace``` like so:
```python
query = query.replace('', '%20')
```

For our ```from``` parameter, it's best to make a date variable beforehand, rather than passing it in with the url. So as we know the API will only returns articles published within the past x days. Note that it is required that the date be in this shape:

```python
'%Y-%m-%d'
```

Let's define a variable that does this using the datetime package:
```python
fromDate = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)
#fromDate is now set to the current date minus 7 days

#reformat
fromDate = fromDate.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
```

Now that we have everything ready, let's put everything together and make our request.

```python
# query = 'artificial%20intelligence'
conn.request("GET", "/v2/everything?q=" + query + "&searchIn=title,description&from=" + fromDate + "&sortby=relevancy&language=en", payload, headers)
```

## 3. Reading the response of our request

In order to retrieve the response of the API, we need to call ```.getResponse()``` which will return an ```HTTPResponse``` object that contains the response data and metadata, such as the status code, headers, and content of the response.

But we can't really do much with this ```HTTPResponse``` object, so we will need to convert it into something we can work with. We start by using ```.read()```.

```.read``` is a method of the HTTPResponse object that reads the content of the response from the server. The content is returned as a bytes object, which can be decoded into a string using the decode method. We do this by just calling ```.decode``` on our bytes object. So now we have this long and confusing string that looks like a JSON file but doesn't have the functionality of a JSON file. We can turn it into a JSON by using ```json.loads```.

```json.loads``` is a function in the Python json module that parses a JSON-formatted string and converts it into a Python object.
Remember, we will give the function the decoded bytes object, which is just a long string that looks like a JSON. The function will return a python dictionary. We can now access the different fields of our response, as if it were a JSON file.


Let's put this in code:
```python
res = conn.getresponse() 
#res is an object of type HTTPResponse

data = res.read() 
#data is a bytes object that needs to be decoded

res = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8"))
#we decode "data" and pass it into json.loads
#res is now a python dictionary
```

After taking these steps, we have a dictionary that looks like this:
![jsonimage](/images/newsapi2.png)

## 4. Final Function
Let's put everything we've done up to this point into a function.
```python
def newsAPIRequest(query:str) -> dict:
  """
  Makes an api request to newsapi.org.
  Requires:
    query: str - the topic to search
  Returns:
    res: dict - a dictionary containing the response
  """
  query = query.replace(' ', '%20')
  fromDate = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=7)
  fromDate = fromDate.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
  conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("newsapi.org")
  payload = ''
  headers = { 
    #remember to store your api key in Secrets!
    'Authorization': os.environ['newsapi_apikey'],
    'User-Agent': os.environ['newsapi_apikey']
  }
  conn.request("GET", "/v2/everything?q=" + query +
               "&searchIn=title,description&from=" + fromDate +
               "&sortby=relevancy&language=en", payload, headers)
  res = conn.getresponse()
  data = res.read()
  res = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8"))
  return res
```

To test it, we will take the same steps as in Lesson 3. Outside of the function in ```APITest.py```, call newsAPIRequest():
```python
#make sure you have all your imports!
def newsAPIRequest(query:str) -> dict:
  ...

response = newsAPIRequest('Artificial Intelligence')
print(response)
```

In the shell, call:
```python
python3 APITest.py
```
If you get a key error for your newsapi_apikey secret, try refreshing the page and rerunning the command in the shell. Once again, this is pretty cluttered and unreadable in Shell, so let's just print one article:

```python
#make sure you have all your imports!
def newsAPIRequest(query:str) -> dict:
  ...

response = newsAPIRequest('Artificial Intelligence')
print(response['articles'][0])
```
Now its easy to see that things are working properly. We see that each article has all of our fields (source, author, description, etc). Now, let's copy and paste ```newsAPIRequest``` into ```utils.py```.

Finally, remember to call this function inside of ```newsPopulateDB``` like so. As a reminder, ```newsPopulateDB``` is just the function that calls other functions:

```python
def newsPopulateDB(query: str):
  res = newsAPIRequest(query)
```
