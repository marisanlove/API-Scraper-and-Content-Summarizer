# Sending to database and retrieving from database

Now that we have a list of articles, we are ready to send this to the database where it will be stored before it is summarized and pushed to the frontend.

If using a replitDB, this is as simple as adding this to ```utils.py```:
```python
def pushArticlesToDB(data: list):
  db['articles'] = data
```

Finally, just remember to call this function in ```newsPopulateDB```. The final ```newsPopulateDB``` should look like this:
```python
def newsPopulateDB(query: str):
  res = newsAPIRequest(query)
  clean_res = cleanNewsAPIRes(res, query)
  pushArticlesToDB(clean_res)
```

## Retrieving from database and adding to context

Now that we have our articles sitting in our database, we need a way to access them.

Let's create a simple getter method and put it in ```utils.py```:
```python
def getArticlesFromDB() -> list:
  return db['articles']
```
All this will do is return all of our articles from the database. But for our webpage, we want to show the top 10 articles, so let's implement that.


We're going to create a new method in ```app.py``` this time, and call it ```getNewsFeed```.

The first step is to grab the first 10 articles. We can do this by slicing. In Python, slicing is a way to extract a portion of a sequence (such as a list, string, or tuple) and return it as a new sequence. It is a useful and efficient way to manipulate and work with large sequences of data. We can get the first 10 articles by calling the ```getArticlesFromDB()``` then slicing it.

```python
articles = getArticlesFromDB()[:10]
```
Next, we can get rid of some fields that we don't need. Source, imageURL, and content will be dropped because our goal is to display a short summary on our webpage, and we only need ```author```, ```title```, ```description```, ```url```, and ```date```.

So let's create an empty list and iterate over ```data``` and append dictionaries with only these fields.

```python
top_articles = []

  for art in articles:
    article = {
      'author': article['author'],
      'title': article['title'],
      'description': article['description'],
      'url': article['url'],
      'date': article['date'],
    }
    top_articles.append(article)
```

The full method looks like this:
```python
def getNewsFeed():
  """
  Retrieve 10 news data from database and extract the fields we'd like
  to display
  """
  articles = getArticlesFromDB()[:10]
  top_articles = []

  for art in articles:
    article = {
      'author': art['author'],
      'title': art['title'],
      'description': art['description'],
      'url': art['url'],
      'date': art['date'],
    }
    
    top_articles.append(article)

  return top_articles

```

From here, ```context['news']``` will be updated in ```query()```, which lesson 6 will cover in more depth. As a sneak peek, the ```context``` variable is what we will be serving to the front end so it should hold the "final answer" to all of our work here in the backend. For example, it will hold our articles, tweets, tweet likes/retweets/comments etc; its contents are what will actually be displayed on our website. More on this in lesson 6.
