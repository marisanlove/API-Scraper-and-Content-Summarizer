## Lesson 3.1: Getting the API Response
The first thing we have to do is get the information we want from Twitter. This is the part where we tell Twitter what we want, and it gives us back the information.
* Step 1:
  * The first step is to create the ```app.py``` file. This file will be the file you run to start the program.
  * In this file, you will create a method called getNewTweets. This method will be responsible for calling other methods to make the GET API request, clean the API request, and sending the top 10 most popular tweets to the database.
  * Add to ```app.py``` (this will result in an error for a second):
    ```python
    def getNewTweets(query: str = query) -> dict:
    ```
    * If the inputs for the method above look strange, don't worry. We are using 2 methods here: type-hinting and setting a default. Type-hinting is a tool that allows us to better document our code by setting what data type we expect a parameter to be. In this case, as we have **query: str**, we are expecting the query parameter to be a string! We then set a default by adding **= query**, which means that if we call getNewTweets() without that input in the call, it will use **query** as that input.
    * The **-> dict** is another kind of type hinting. It is telling us that this method will return a dictionary!
* Step 2:
  * We now need to define what the default **query** variable is going to be for that method.
  * You can set the default query to be anything! For the example project, we will be setting this to "artificial intelligence".
  * If you have not done so already, create a file called ```constants.py```. Add this to ```constants.py```:
    ```python
    query = "artificial intelligence"
    ```
  * Next, we need to import the ```constants.py``` into ```app.py```. We can do this by adding the following to the top of ```app.py```. We also can import the replit database feature that we're going to use later.
    ```python
    from constants import *
    from replit import db

    ```
    * The * is the wildcard operator. In this context, in means "all". Everything from ```constants.py``` will be imported!
* Step 3:
  * Our **getNewTweets()** is still giving us an error! That's cause we haven't put anything in it yet. Next we're going to make a method that will go in there.
  * Before we can do that, we need to make a new file to store this method in! This method will be stored in ```utils.py```. Go ahead and make that file now.
  * At the top of ```utils.py```, we are going to add the libraries we are going to use for this method. Add this to the top of ```utils.py```:
    ```python
    import json
    import http.client
    import datetime
    from constants import *
    from replit import db
    import os
    ```
  * In ```utils.py```, we're going to make the method to make the twitter API call. But first, we strongly suggest creating a testing file where you can test-run the API calls and make sure things are working before copy-pasting it into ```utils.py```, where it'd be tough to test/debug. To do this, create another file called ```APITest.py``` and add the following function as well as the above imports. At the end, we will be copying everything you do in ```APITest.py``` back into ```utils.py```. 
    ```python
    def makeTwitterRequest(query: str = query) -> dict:
    ```
* Step 4:
  * In this step, we are going to start to set the time range we want to get our tweets from. We are going to track this with 2 variables: **Current_Date** and **Previous_Date**, which allow us to make **start_time** and **end_time**. In order to allow tweets time to gain popularity, we want our current date to reflect 1 hour prior to the actual current time.
  * Add this to **makeTwitterRequest()**:
    ```python3
    Current_Date = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(hours=1)
    Previous_Date = Current_Date - datetime.timedelta(seconds=300)
    
    start_time = Previous_Date.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    end_time = Current_Date.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
    ```
  * This code sets **Current_Date** to be an hour ago by subtracting an hour from the current time and date, then sets **Previous_Date** to be 5 minutes (or 300 seconds) before that. This sets the range that we are looking for tweets to be 60 to 65 minutes ago.
  * The two lines after that take those variables and puts them into a format that the twitter API understands.
* Step 5:
  * In this step, we're going to establish the connection to the twitter API over the internet and set some of the extra information that twitter needs to process our request. Finally, change our query so it works.
  * We use the http.client library to establish this connection. Add this to **makeTwitterRequest()**:
  ```python
  conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.twitter.com")
  ```
  * Next, we are going to create the information that twitter needs. If you do not have secrets set up, please go back to and review the secrets lesson.
  ```python
  payload = ''
  headers = {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + bearer_token, # or os.environ['tBearer'] if you didn't create bearer_token
  'Cookie': 'guest_id=' + guest_id # or os.environ['tGuest'] instead of guest_id
  }
  ```
  * The 'Cookie' section of the headers dictionary can be left out, but the bearer token is necessary for authorizing our access to the API.
  * Finally, we are going to edit the query a bit. URLs don't allow spaces, so if our query has one it'll ruin the request! URLs use %20 instead of a space. Add this!
  ```python
  query = query.replace(" ", "%20")
  ```
* Step 6:
  * Now we're going to make the request! We're going to set some variables to help us tell twitter what we want, then send the request!
  * In ```constants.py```, we're going to set the language of the tweets we want, and how many tweets we want. Add these to ```constants.py```!
  ```python
  language = 'en'
  tweetsPerRequest = 100
  ```
  * Now we're ready to make the request! Add this to **makeTwitterRequest()** in ```utils.py```:
  ```python
  conn.request(
    "GET", "/2/tweets/search/recent?query=" + query +
    "%20-is:retweet%20lang:" + language + "&start_time=" + start_time +
    "&end_time=" + end_time + "&max_results=" + str(tweetsPerRequest) +
    "&tweet.fields=author_id,created_at,text,public_metrics",
    payload, headers)
  ```
    * If you read though this, you'll notice a few things: we use -is:retweet to tell twitter we don't want retweets. They clog up the process by giving us a lot of one thing and by not giving us the full text! We also ask for author_id, created_at, text, and public_metrics for each tweet. We will use all of these later!
* Step 7:
  * We now need to listen for the response, translate it into something we can use, and look for any errors. Then we return the response!
  * To get the response and read it, add this to makeTwitterRequest():
    ```python
    res = conn.getresponse()
    data = res.read()
    ```
  * When we get this response, it looks something like this: ![jsonimage](/images/jsonResponse.PNG)
  * For now, we're going to translate it into a python dictionary and we'll clean it up in no time! Add this:
  ```python
  responseDict = {}
  responseDict = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8"))
  ```
  * We start **responseDict** as a dictionary so that json.loads() knows to give us a dictionary!
  * Next, we want to check the response to see if we have any errors, and if we do, print them so we know what they are. Add this:
    ```python
    if 'errors' in responseDict:
      for err in responseDict['errors']:
        print(err['message'])
    ```
  * This looks to see if there's something called 'errors' in the response, and prints each of them out if there is.
  * Finally, we can return the response! Add this:
  ```python
  return responseDict
  ```

### Congratulations! You now have a function that can get tweets. Let's test it and make sure everything works.

In ```APITest.py```, add a line outside of the function we have just created that calls ```makeTwitterRequest``` and prints the result. Make sure you imported all the necessary things at the top! This will look like:
```python
#imports here
def makeTwitterRequest(query: str = query) -> dict:
  ...

response = makeTwitterRequest('Artificial Intelligence')
print(response)
```
In order to run our ```APITest.py``` file, we need to navigate to the Shell and type in:
```
python3 APITest.py
```

The output will look extremely cluttered, so let's just print one tweet by accessing the ```data``` ket of our returned dictionary, and selecting the first tweet from the list:
```python
#imports here
def makeTwitterRequest(query: str = query) -> dict:
  ...

response = makeTwitterRequest('Artificial Intelligence')
print(response['data'][0])
```

Once again, run the file through the Shell. This should look cleaner and we're now able to see that our function works as intended. We see our public metrics like ```retweet_count``` and ```like_count```, along with the actual ```text```.

Now, just copy and paste this function back into ```utils.py```

## Calling the function in app.py
  * Add this under the other imports in ```app.py```:
   ```python3
   from utils import *
   ```
  * then add this to **getNewTweets()** in ```app.py```:
  ```python
  tweet_data = makeTwitterRequest(query)['data']
  ```
