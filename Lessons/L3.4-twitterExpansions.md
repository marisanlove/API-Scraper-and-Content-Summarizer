## Lesson 3.4 Expansions: 
### Controlling the Database
* Step One:
  * Our final program for this lesson is creating a small program that clears the database if ran. This is needed so that if there's a problem in your code that adds things to the database but doesn't clear them, you can clear it. Create a new file named ```clearDB.py```.
* Step Two:
  * Add the following code to ```clearDB.py```:
    ```python3
    from replit import db
    db.clear()
    print("Database cleared!")
    ```
  * This clears the database using the db.clear() method in replit's db class. You can run this by typing this in the shell:
    ```shell
    python3 clearDB.py
    ```
    
That's it for this lesson. We created an API Request, got the response, cleaned and sorted a huge pile of data to get the information we wanted, and got it ready to use later. If you want to see what the data looks like, add this to ```app.py```!
### Optional: Printing the Results
If you want to see what you've done so far, add this to ``app.py``! This will print out the top 10 tweets your API request got for you in an easy-to-read way. **At the end, don't forget to delete or comment out the bottom two lines.**
```python
def printTweetInfo(data: dict):
  for tweet in data:
    print("Author ID:" + str(tweet['author']))
    print("Date: " + str(tweet['date']))
    print("Text: " + tweet['text'])
    print("Retweets, Likes, Replies" + str(tweet['retweets']) + ", " + str(tweet['likes']) + ", " + str(tweet['replies']))
    print("Popularity: ") + str(tweet['popularity'])
    print("----------------------------------------")

getNewTweets()
printTweetInfo(db['top10'])
```



### Other Expansions:
* Change the API request by editing or generating a new one on Postman. What happens?
* Replace the bubble sort in Lesson 3.3: Step 3 with another sorting algorithm, such as selection sort or quick sort. Research yourself or using [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms-in-python/).
