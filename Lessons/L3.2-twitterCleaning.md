## Lesson 3.2: Cleaning the Response
Right now, the response is in a messy python dictionary. In this part, we're going to clean the response into something we can use and send it to the database.
* Step 1:
  * First, we're going to make a method that gives each tweet a "popularity score" based on how many likes, retweets, and replies it has.
  * Go to ```constants.py``` and add the following:
    ```python
    valueList = [1, 3, 5]
    ```
  * This sets the default value of a like, a retweet, and a reply to a tweet's popularity score. We'll set up the program so this can be changed when the method is called.
  * In ```utils.py```, write this:
    ```python
    def pointVal(dict: dict, valueList: list = valueList) -> int:
      likeVal = valueList[0]
      rtVal = valueList[1]
      replyVal = valueList[2]
  
      score = dict['like_count'] * likeVal
      score += dict['retweet_count'] * rtVal
      score += dict['reply_count'] * replyVal
      return score
  * Woah! That's a lot at once. Lets break it down. The method takes a dictionary that has these values: 'like_count', 'retweet_count', and 'reply_count'. It also takes a list of numerical values, and multiplies those metrics by the first 3 list entries. It calculates the total score by adding all these up, then returns it.
    * Try to find what would be returned in the following call, then go to the bottom for the answer:
      ```python
      pointVal({'like_count': 3, 'retweet_count': 2, 'reply_count': 1}, [1, 2, 3])
      ```

  * Now we need a method to change the date and time of the tweets to the format we'll be using. Add this to ```utils.py```:
  ```python
  def parseDate(orig: str) -> datetime:
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(orig, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z")
  ```
* Step 3:
  * Now we're going to write a method that takes the dictionary from **makeTwitterRequest()** and cleans it into something more usuable to us.
  * Add this to ```utils.py```:
    ```python
    def tweetsPopulateDB(data: dict):

      #Start a list to keep the new dictionaries in!
      posts = []

      for t in data:
        temp = {
          'text': t['text'],
          'id': t['id'],
          'date': t['created_at'],
          'author': t['author_id'],
          'retweets': t['public_metrics']['retweet_count'],
          'likes': t['public_metrics']['like_count'],
          'replies': t['public_metrics']['reply_count'],
          'popularity': pointVal(t['public_metrics'])
        }
        posts.append(temp)
    ```
  * This takes the nested dictionaries from the input dictionary and sorts them into a more usuable dictionary. This simplifies your code so that it is more readable, something you should always strive for.
* Step 4:
  * Next, we're going to add a section of code that sorts the tweets based on the popularity score of these tweets. Thanks to the code we've already written, all of the information for tweets is in **posts**. To sort them by popularity, we're going to use the bubble sort algorithm.
  * Add the following to **tweetsPopulateDB()**:
    ```python
    for i in range(len(posts)): #for every tweet in posts
      for j in range(0, len(posts)-i-1): #look at everything before i
        #if the post we're looking at is more popular
        if posts[j]['popularity'] > posts[j+1]['popularity']: 
          #swap the position of the two posts so the more popular is first
          posts[j], posts[j+1] = posts[j+1], posts[j]
          
    #fill the 'top10' section in the database with the top 10 tweets
    db['top10'] = posts[:10]
    #return a count of how many posts you grabbed for the front-end!
    return len(posts)
    ```
  * Read the comments on the code above to better understand the code. You'll use sorting algorithms in computer science no matter where you end up, so it's important to know them!
