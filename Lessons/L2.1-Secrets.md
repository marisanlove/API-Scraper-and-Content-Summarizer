## Using Replit's "Secrets" Tool

### Accessing the tool
You can access Replit's secrets tool by reading the documentation [here](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/storing-sensitive-information-environment-variables). The information can be accessed in python3 (one of the languages we will be using for this project) like this:
```python3
import os
value = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
```
Do not add that to your project yet.

Using secrets is helpful so you can share your code and collaborate with others without giving away sensitive information like passwords and API keys. With this information, someone can lock you out of accounts and charge you lots of money.

If you have not done so already, go ahead and save your twitter bearer token to ``tBearer`` in your secrets. It may help to create variables that call our secrets when we need them, but this is optional. Create a new file called ```constants.py```. At the top of ```constants.py``` you will need to add
```python
import os
```
so that the file can locate your secrets. In there, also add:
```python
bearer_token = os.environ['tBearer']
```
You may also need to save your guest_id from the postman code snippet. Click the </> button on the right to view the code and copy the string of characters after guest_id= . Save it as a new secret called ``tGuest``.

In ```constants.py```, add:
```python
guest_id = os.environ['tGuest']
```
