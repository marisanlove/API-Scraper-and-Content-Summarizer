# Incorporating the Huggingface API

Hugging Face is a company that provides a platform for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It offers a suite of open-source NLP libraries and tools that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including language translation, text classification, text generation, and more.

In this Project, we'll be using Huggingface to summarize ``` 'clean_text' ```, which are the tweets from the API that have been cleaned from profanity. Summarizing the tweets allows the user to digest more information in a smaller package. 


## Step 1: Making your Huggingface API account

To use the Hugging Face API, you will need to sign up for an account and obtain an API key. Here's how to do that:

1. Go to the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co/) and click on the "Sign Up" button in the top right corner of the page.

</br>

2. Fill out the form to create a new account, including your name, email address, and a password.

</br>

3. Once you have created your account, you can click on your profile icon in the top right corner of your HomePage. In that dropdown, select "Settings" and then select "Access Tokens" on the left side of the page.

</br>

4. Select "New Token", and then create a name for a token and select ```'Read'```   for the ```'Role'``` permissions. Select "generate a token". This is your API Key, and will be used to interface with the huggingface BART model, which summarizes the input.

Now you have your account and token ready for the next step!

## Step 2: Environment Variables and Securely Storing your Credentials

An **environment variable** is a value that can be set outside of your code and accessed by your code at runtime. These variables are often used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and other secrets, that should not be stored directly in your code.

There are several reasons for one to use environment variables:

- **Security**: By storing sensitive information in environment variables rather than in your code, you can prevent it from being accidentally exposed or shared publicly. This is especially important for information like API keys, which can be used to access sensitive data or resources.

- **Flexibility**: Environment variables allow you to easily change the values of sensitive information without having to modify your code. For example, if you need to rotate or update an API key, you can do so by simply updating the environment variable rather than updating your code and redeploying your application.

- **Reusability**: Using environment variables can make it easier to reuse your code across different environments or configurations. For example, you can use the same codebase to access an API in both your development and production environments, simply by setting different values for the API key in each environment.

In summary, environment variables are a useful tool for storing and managing sensitive information in a way that is **secure, flexible, and reusable**. 

In the case of the Hugging Face API key, **storing it in an environment variable** rather than in your code can help to keep it secure and prevent it from being accidentally exposed or shared.


### Storing the Huggingface API key in an Environment Variable:
Remember, to securely store and use API keys, we have to use environment variables. Fortunately, Replit offers this functionaility! 

1. On the bottom left corner of your replit workspace, there should be a section titled ```"Tools."``` Click on the ```"Secrets"``` button, which has a lock icon. This will open up your secrets page.

2. Once you've clicked on the lock button, there should be a place for you to input some credentials. In the ```key``` box, you will name the variable. in this case, **make sure to name it** ```inference_api```. In the ```value``` box, paste in the  API key you generated on the Huggingface website earlier.

4. Now click on ```"Add new Secret"```. There you have it! You've now created a new environment Variable!
