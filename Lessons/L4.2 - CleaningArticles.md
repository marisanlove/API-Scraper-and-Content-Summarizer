# Clean our dictionary and get it ready to send to the database

Our response now takes the form of a dictionary with keys ```status```, ```totalResults```, and ```articles```. As we can see, all of the things we care about (title, author, content, etc) is tucked away in another dictionary in ```articles```.


We want to clean this up a little and get rid of the nested dictionaries, rename some keys, and return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary is one article.

We can accomplish this by looping through ```['articles']``` and making a new dictionary with just the fields in ```['articles']``` and appending these 1-D dictionaries to a list.

Let's call this function ```cleanNewsAPIRes```. Define it in ```utils.py```. It will take in the dictionary from our last step, and also the query. We use the query to make sure that an article is acutually pertinent and should be displayed on our webpage. It is possible that the NewsAPI gave us some articles that are not actually relevant.

Our function will look like this:

```python
def cleanNewsAPIRes(data:dict, query:str) -> list:
  """
  Cleans the API response dictionary into a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary holding the info for one article. Any articles that do not have the query in the description or title are dropped.
  Requires:
    data: dict - a dictionary of the api response
    query: str - the query of the search
  Returns:
    output: list - a list of dictionaries, each an article
  """
  
output = []

  for art in data['articles']:
    if (query in art['description']) or (query in art['title']):
      temp = {
      'source': art['source']['name'],
      'author': art['author'],
      'title': art['title'],
      'description': art['description'],
      'url': art['url'],
      'imageLink': art['urlToImage'],
      'date': art['publishedAt'],
      'content': art['content']
      }
      output.append(temp)
    #
  #

  return output
```
Now, we have a list of dictionaries that looks like this:

We got rid of the nested dictionaries and renamed a couple fields. Looking clean!

Once again, remember to call this function in ```newsPopulateDB``` and pass in the uncleaned response ```res``` and the ```query```.
```python
def newsPopulateDB(query: str):
  res = newsAPIRequest(query)
  clean_res = cleanNewsAPIRes(res, query)
```
